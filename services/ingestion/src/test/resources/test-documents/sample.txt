This is a sample text document for integration testing.

It contains multiple paragraphs to test the chunking and extraction functionality
of the ingestion service.

The document processing pipeline should:
1. Fetch this document from S3
2. Extract the text content
3. Chunk the content into smaller pieces
4. Send the chunks for vector processing

This is the end of the sample document.
